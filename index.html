    <p><strong>Welcome to Fighting Tiers!</strong> Where no matter how much you cry, your favorite fighters will not rise in tiers! This site was created by
    a fighting game fan who wanted to display which characters are the best or worst in their respect to their game. I do not have any affiliation
    with any of the creators of these games and this site is purely just for fun/educational purposes, enjoy.</p>
